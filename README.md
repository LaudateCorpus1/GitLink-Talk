This talk introduces GitLink, an under-development technology that Wolfram Research is actively using internally and will soon be shipping as part of the [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/), available in Mathematica, Wolfram Desktop, and Wolfram Cloud products.

As this material covers an under-development project, the code contained herein won't actually run yet, and the final version of GitLink may have small syntactic and functionality changes from what's been demonstrated here.  If that should happen, the talk notebook will be updated with a suitably functional version of the code.

Also, some of the examples required a meaty repo to demonstrate.  Sorry, the repo I used for
demonstration purposes is not public.
